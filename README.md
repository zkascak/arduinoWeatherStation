## Project Description

There will be two versions of this project, the first will be based on the Arduino UNO with an ethernet shield. The second will be using the Arduino YÃšN. This station will include measure temperature, humidity, air pressure and will try use a photocell to detect how cloudy it is during the day time.

## Hardware Requirements

* Arduino UNO Rev. 3
* Velleman Analogue Temperature Sensor VM320
* Temperature and Barometric Sensor BMP180
* SparkFun Humidity Sensor HH4030
* Photocell
* Resistor
