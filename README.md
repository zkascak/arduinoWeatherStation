# arduinoWeatherStation
An Arduino based weather station.

There will be two versions of this project, the first will be based on the Arduino UNO with an ethernet shield. The second will be using the Arduino YÃšN. This station will include measure temperature, humidity, air pressure and will try use a photocell to detect how cloudy it is during the day time.
